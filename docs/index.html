    <h3>What is Quartz?</h3>
    
    <p>Quartz is an open source job scheduling system that can be integrated 
    with, or used along side virtually any J2EE or J2SE application. Quartz can 
    be used to create simple or complex schedules for executing tens, hundreds, 
    or even tens-of-thousands of jobs; jobs whose tasks are defined as standard 
    Java components or EJBs.</p>
    
    <h3>What can Quartz do for you?</h3>
    
    <p>If your application has tasks that need to occur at given moments 
    in time, or if your system has recurring maintenance jobs  then Quartz may 
    be your ideal solution.</p>
    
    <p>Sample uses of job scheduling with Quartz:</p>
    
    <ul>
    
        <li>Driving Workflow:  As a new order is initially placed, schedule a Job 
        to fire in exactly 2 hours, that will check the status of that order, and 
        trigger a warning notification if an order confirmation message has not 
        yet been received for the order, as well as changing the order's status to 
        'awaiting intervention'.</li>
        
        <li>System Maintenance: Schedule a job to dump the contents of a database 
        into an XML file every business day (all weekdays except holidays) at 
        11:30 PM.</li>
    </ul>
        
    <h3>Free as in Beer?</h3>
    
    <p>The goal of the Quartz project is to create and maintain a fully 
    featured, free-for-commercial-use, enterprise-class job scheduler.</p>
    
    <p>The licensing of Quartz is similar to both the BSD and ASF (Apache) 
    public licenses, which means it's free for use, even within commercial 
    products.</p>
    
    <p>Although Quartz is free, your donations are gladly accepted - they go 
    directly to enabling the development and support of future versions of 
    Quartz. Donations are accepted via the <a 
    href="https://sourceforge.net/project/project_donations.php?group_id=23781"> 
    donation system</a> on SourceForge.</p>
    
    <h3>Who is using Quartz?</h3>
    
    <p>Quartz is in use by thousands of people, many of whom have directly 
    embedded Quartz in their own applications, and others who are using products 
    that already have Quartz embedded within them.</p>
    
    
    Here is a list of just a few Quartz users:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Vodafone Ireland</b> - uses Quartz for scheduling tests to be carried out on systems in order to generate quality of service information.</li>
        <li><b>Covalent Technologies, Inc.</b> - uses Quartz within their CAM product to handle anything scheduling related in the system,
        such as: scheduling server actions (start, restart, etc.), metric
        calculations, data cleanup daemons, etc.</li>
        <li><b>PartNET Inc.</b> - uses Quartz for scheduling application event and driving workflows within many of its products.</li>
        <li><b>U.S. Department of Defence</b> - uses Quartz at various points within an electronic commerce application.</li>
        <li><b>Level3 Communications</b> - uses Quartz to drive software builds and deployments.</li>
        <li><b>Atlassian</b> - uses Quartz within their JIRA and Confluence products.</li>
        <li><b>Cisco</b> - uses Quartz in various in-house systems.</li>
